# SurvPlant-ML
This project is our final project for Google Bangkit Academy 2024.


**Backgrounder:**

Today, more than 820 million people worldwide face challenges of hunger or food insecurity, especially in remote areas with limited access to resources. On the other hand, many wild plants are rich in nutrients but often go unrecognized and untapped. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies have shown great potential in providing practical solutions to these problems. By leveraging machine learning models, we can develop a plant detection system that can be easily accessed through mobile devices. This solution not only helps to identify edible plants but also provides information on their nutritional content, which is crucial to support emergency food needs, especially in survival situations.

**Machine Learning:** 

Building models that include [Edible PLants Detection](). Build process using *baseline experiment, early stopping. Pre-trained model or transfer learning by inceptionv3*. The model was saved with *model.tfjs* and chosen by the [best model](https://github.com/RamziAhmar/SurvPlant/blob/model-ml/CapstoneProject(uplaod).ipynb) for deployment.

**Case :**

- [x] Edible Plants Classification
